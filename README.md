# Noughts
I created a noughts and crosses game known as Tic Tac Toe. I wanted to make a simple browser game where both players can have fun playing online.
HTLM was integrated first with the elements such as divs, sections, headers and more. In the divs, I included class cell and id each div in order to make our game work and that will also help with our Javascript functions. 
CSS was used mainly for centering and padding the reset button. The css design for the reset button was mostly done in the HTML file. The winning message was styled in the HTML file as well. The header was also used for styling. I used a dark turquoise color background for the border with a large size font.
In the javaScript file, I added query selectors for each div targetting the ID's. Then I added an array with the number of different winning conditions based on the number of boxes in the game. I added switch statement for each playerturn. I also added a winning alert function with combination of arrays and based on where each player places the symbol, its going to detect the winner. Each event listener had a "this" method to make the click work.
